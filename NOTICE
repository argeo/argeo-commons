# Eclipse Public License Permission

Linking Argeo Commons statically or dynamically with other modules is making a 
combined work based on Argeo Commons. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU 
General Public License cover the whole combination when this license becomes 
applicable.

In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders of Argeo Commons give 
you permission to combine Argeo Commons with any program released under the 
terms and conditions of the Eclipse Public License v1.0, v2.0 (even without a 
Secondary License enabled) or any later version of this license. You may copy 
and distribute such a system following the terms of the GNU GPL for Argeo Commons 
and the licenses of the other code concerned, provided that you include the 
source code of that other code when and as the GNU GPL requires distribution of

Note that people who make modified versions of Argeo Commons are not obligated 
to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is their choice 
whether to do so. The GNU General Public License gives permission to release a 
modified version without this exception; this exception also makes it possible 
to release a modified version which carries forward this exception.
