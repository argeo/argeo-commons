Argeo Commons is a lightweight integration framework in pure Java 17, and the foundation for all other Argeo layers.

It provides APIs (org.argeo.api.* components), a simple CMS with LDAP and Kerberos integration for authentication/authorisation, and an UI framework based on Eclipse RAP/RCP.

The central component is org.argeo.cms, which implements a "node" that can be used either as a server (typically with an Eclipse RAP web interface) or a client (typically with an Eclipse RCP desktop interface).

## Build
Prerequisites to build this layer:
- build Argeo TP
(cf. http://git.argeo.org)

Then, run:

git clone http://git.argeo.org/gpl/argeo-commons.git --recursive
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64/
./argeo-tp/configure

cd argeo-tp
make clean all

In order to use it within an Eclipse PDE environment:

make clean all manifests

which will copy the generated OSGi MANIFESTs back to the source tree. The *.target files in argeo-tp/sdk can then be used to configure the target platforms.

In order to develop with the Eclipse RCP components (Eclipse RAP being the default), additionally run:

make -f Makefile-rcp.mk manifests
